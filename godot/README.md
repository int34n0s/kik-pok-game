# Kik-Pok Game UI

So, overall there is a need to develop a few levels to make the game more entertaining

Also because the arena part of the game is too complicated technically (server truth thing), there will be focus 
only on the puzzle and hunting parts.

To make a game more entertaining there will be a singleplayer (possible to complete alone), multiplayer (kinda not possible to complete alone),
and group game (good luck completing it alone). The last part is going to require more than 4 players to complete the level on the normal difficulty 

The main improvements to be designed: 

- Menu experience: 
  - it would be nice for the user to have an advance options (manual server link)
  - Fix an interaction with node. Everything should be an instant with some sort of animations during pauses 
  - The UI should be easy to grasp with one look 

- Server selection part. There is a need to be able to join the server overall. With some code or something 

Game design: 

puzzles: there is a need to build levels with puzzles
This would require too accommodate more that just a vision of the player: 
- sound system 
- animation system 
- texts 

The puzzles are required to be layered, so there is always is bottom inside it
The puzzles should be "independent" from the game. The best thing if they are "mathematically" correct

Treasury hunting: 
The idea is collectables.

This part would require the server redesign, but idea overall is to define "shiny" and non-"shiny" collectables 

Artifacts: ones that can improve player stats: jump boosts, speed boosts, etc. (network issue?)

The most important part: player interaction with the world. What can be changed by the player? How much freedom he has, etc.
